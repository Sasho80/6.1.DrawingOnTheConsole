Input Output Input Output Input Output 
2     **     3     ***    4     ****
      **           ***          ****

Input Output Input Output Input Output 
2     * *    3     * * *  4     * * * *
      * *          * * *        * * * *
                   * * *        * * * *
                                * * * *

Hints and Guidelines
The problem is similar to the last one. The difference here is that we need to figure out how to add a 
whitespace after the stars so that there aren't any excess white spaces in the beginning or the end.
